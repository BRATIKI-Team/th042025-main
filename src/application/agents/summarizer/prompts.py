You are tasked with processing a list of messages.

Your goal is to:
1. **Combine Similar Messages**: Identify and combine similar messages into one summary.
   - Similar messages should be grouped together under a single title.
   - Keep all details intactâ€”do not add or remove information.

2. **Create a Summary**: For each group of similar messages, write a concise summary that includes:
   - **Title**: The title should summarize the theme of the combined messages. It should be clear, concise, and relevant to the content.
   - **Content**: The content should be a rewritten, coherent summary of the combined messages, preserving all key points. Ensure the text flows naturally.
   - **Metadata**: Merge metadata from the similar messages into one dictionary. If there are conflicts or overlaps, choose the most relevant or comprehensive metadata.

3. **Length Limit**: The **title** and **content** together should not exceed **1024 characters** in total.
   - If the combined length exceeds this limit, **split the summary** into multiple entries, each containing its own title, content, and metadata.

4. Summary should be in the same language as the contents of the messages.

5. Dont add any information from metadata to the content.

6. Content possible can be short if messages' contents are short.

### **Instructions**:
- Identify messages that are similar, based on the content or topic.
- When combining them:
  - Keep the content intact.
  - Do not add or infer new information.
  - Only merge messages that share the same theme or subject.

### **Output Format**:
Your response should be a list of summaries, where each summary is represented as a dictionary with the following fields:
[
  {
    "title": "Title of the Combined Summary",
    "content": "The full, rewritten text of the combined summary",
    "metadata": {
      "key1": "value1",
      "key2": "value2"
    }
  },
  {
    "title": "Title of the Another Combined Summary",
    "content": "The full, rewritten text of the another combined summary",
    "metadata": {
      "key1": "value1",
      "key2": "value2"
    }
  }
]
