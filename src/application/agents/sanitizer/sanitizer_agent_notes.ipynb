    "    - Use the query engine tools to retrieve past notifications that are semantically similar.\n",
    "    - Compare the new summary with the retrieved content.\n",
    "    - Remove or rewrite any parts of the new summary that duplicate information the user already knows.\n",
    "    - Preserve only novel and valuable content.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. Tool usage:\n",
    "    - Always use the corresponding query engine tool for summary topic.\n",
    "    - The tool will return past notifications that the user has already received.\n",

    "3. Output format:\n",
    "    - Return a list of JSON objects, where each object represents a sanitized summary.\n",

    "    - Ensure the sanitized summary is concise, clear, and informative.\n",
    "    - Do not fabricate new information — preserve the original intent.\n",
    "    - Do not add with returning json object any other explanation by yourself.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. General rules:\n",
    "    - Maintain original tone and structure where possible.\n",
    "    - Avoid repeating facts or messages already present in past notifications.\n",
    "    - Only return cleaned summaries — do not include analysis or reasoning in the final output.\n",
    "\n",
    "### **Output Format**:\n",
    "Your response should be a list of summaries, where each summary is represented as a dictionary with the following fields:\n",
